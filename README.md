# ASTR204JupyterAssignments
Jupyter Notebook Assignments Used for ASTR204 (in Fall 2019 and 2021 Semesters at Haverford College)

To run these you need: 
* matplotlib
* numpy
* astropy

I recommend using SciServer.org free online Jupyter Notebooks (student - you need to download from here and upload to Sciserver Compute Volume set up with the Astro packages, and these just work). 

Contents: 
* HW1 - learn basic file input and plotting using sunspot number data
* HW2 - learn how to use python functions to make repeat calculations (example based on occupation numbers of atomic levels and using an astropy function to plot star positions)
* HW3 - more file read in, plotting, and fits to data (using stellar data)
* HW4 - more fitting to data, using Cepheid variable star data
* HW5 - working with images in python (with images of a supernova). 
* HW6 - Please do the NASA Exoplanet Archive Tutorial (https://github.com/howardisaacson/Intro-to-Astro-2021/blob/master/Week3_gaia_exoplanet_archive/nasa_exoplanet_archive_tutorial_KEY.ipynb) from Howard Isaacson's Intro to Astronomical Research (https://github.com/howardisaacson/Intro-to-Astro-2021)
* Final HW - Galaxies and large scale structure work through (written by Rita Tojeiro, October 2017, for the Lab component of the AS1001 Cosmology module at the University of St Andrews, UK. It was modified to stand alone in an SDSS EPO workshop at AAS in Jan 2018 and then significantly modified to emphasize developing programming skills by Andrea Lommen, Haverford College, January 2018. This notebook has benefited from examples provided by Britt Lundgren (University of North Carolina) and Jordan Raddick (John Hopkins University). Tweaked by Karen Masters for ASTR204 Fall 2019) 
* Example 20m Data reduction - how to load 21cm line data from the Skynet 20m at GBO into python for analysis (was part of a lab in the 2019 version of ASTR204).
